                  That’s the first year where I was using that much staff about websites. I have never created website before, but I can easily say it’s interesting and I
                   would like to do some more projects which include creation of the website. HTML and CSS are not that difficult to understand and work with them. 
                  For a while I was working with it and creating many errors, but each mistake is teaching me how to do it better and make my work looks best. </p>
                    <p> While creating this website I have faced many challenges with content and design of the website. Right now, after all that work I understand where
                         I did my mistakes and how to look at the code without any problem with full awareness. </p>

                        <p> After all the time I spend on this website I can easily say that creating website for single platform which is desktop isn’t hard, finding out what to
                          do to create website in other devices such as mobile phones, tablets and other things with different resolution is a little harder and possible to do in
                           quite good time. Because of that now I can create website which is visible on all the devices with different navigation bar for smaller screens.
                            I did also work to provide code that will give possibility to open my website also on other platforms.
                          I have spent some time on the internet looking for solutions and after a while I did working website without problem.
                </p><p>For this I explored multiple pages with different designs and other backgrounds. My priority was to create good looking website for an eye and easy accessible
                     by people.</p>
                <p><br> </br> </p>
                <p><br> </br> </p>
                <strong><p>Also, I have used my past projects wireframes for planning my website and design on it. This are my wireframes I been following while designing my page:</p></strong>
                    </p> 
                     <div class='img'>
                            <img width="760" height="515" src="img/wire1.JPG" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <!-- image of the wireframe 1 -->
                        </div>
                        <p><br> </br> </p>
                        <p><br> </br> </p>
                        <div class='img'>
                               <img width="760" height="515" src="img/wire2.JPG" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                             <!-- image of the wireframe 2 -->
                           </div>
                           <p><br> </br> </p>
                           <p><br> </br> </p>

                           <strong><p> Next thing I am going to show are my screenshots from site validation with errors that I been forces to fix:</p></strong>
<p>As we can see there are some errors which I was unable to fix</p>
